Online brewing application that provides:
  * Recipe designer

All written in Ruby on Rails

The goal is to support the brewing community with a low cost, feature rich, brewing application that will mix brewing calculators with an online brewing reference for brewers of all ability.

**Who are we looking for?**

Anyone who is passionate about brewing, and/or web application development.

You don't have to have technical expertise to be able to contribute.

Got a great idea you want to see developed?  Even just being able to raise bug reports when things go wrong, or add some user documentation goes a long way to making Brewtoolz a better system for all of us.

Below are some of the areas we are look for people to get involved in:
  * Testers (can be as easy as just raising bugs as you come across them)
  * Specifiers
  * Documenters
  * Coders
  * Web designers


We are particularly in need of some web designers.
