# Introduction #

In order to make it easier to get an operational development environment.  A VirtualBox virtual Ubuntu server (12.04)  has been created with all the components required to get run brewtoolz except for the mysql database.

# Quick start guide #
**Install prerequisites
  * [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
  * Mysql (note mysql can be installed in the virtual environment)**

**Download Virtualised Ubuntu server**

**Configure mysql database**

**Checkout code**

**Run server**

# Details #

The virtual machine has been configured to run all the elements except for the mysql database.

This can easily be added if you want to run the whole stack within the visualized environment. See the section below on the database setup for more information.

The virtual server also has shared folder active to allow for ease of integration between the host and guest machines.

It also means you can use all your favourite IDE and editing tools on the host environment rather than on the text only server virtual machine.  See the section on shared folders for more information.

The virtual server as previously mentioned is based on Oracles VirtualBox platform that is currently supported on Mac, Linux and Windows environments.

To get started with VirtualBox have a look at the [VirtualBox website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
